### 3.5.0
released on 2017-07-30 <br/>

* [568](https://github.com/javers/javers/issues/568)
 Added the new scope for Shadow queries &mdash; <b>commit-depth+</b>.
 In this scope, JaVers tries to restore an original object graph
 with (possibly) all object references resolved.
 See [Shadow Scopes](/documentation/jql-examples/#shadow-scopes).

### 3.3.5
released on 2017-07-14 <br/>
                       
* [565](https://github.com/javers/javers/issues/565)
 Fixed error when executing query byInstance with HibernateUnproxyObjectAccessHook. 

### 3.3.4
released on 2017-07-04 <br/>
                       
* [560](https://github.com/javers/javers/issues/560)
 Fixed NPE when getting empty list of Shadows.

### 3.3.3
released on 2017-06-29 <br/>
                       
* [548](https://github.com/javers/javers/issues/548)
 Added support for classes generated by Google [@AutoValue](https://github.com/google/auto/tree/master/value).

### 3.3.2
released on 2017-06-25 <br/>
                       
* [546](https://github.com/javers/javers/issues/546)
 Arrays on Value position are now compared using `Arrays.equals()`.

### 3.3.1
released on 2017-06-25 <br/>
                       
* [497](https://github.com/javers/javers/issues/497)
 Fix in PolyJDBC for MsSql, deprecated `TEXT` column type changed to `VARCHAR(MAX)` 

### 3.3.0
released on 2017-06-21 at Devoxx PL, Cracow <br/>

* Added possibility to register
 the [CustomValueComparator]({{ site.javadoc_url }}org/javers/core/diff/custom/CustomValueComparator.html)
 function for comparing ValueTypes
 (it works also for Values stored in Lists, Arrays and Maps).
 Solved issues: [492](https://github.com/javers/javers/issues/492),
                [531](https://github.com/javers/javers/issues/531).
 
 For example, BigDecimals are (by default) ValueTypes
 compared using `BigDecimal.equals()`.
 Now, you can compare them in the smarter way, ignoring trailing zeros:
 
```java 
 javersBuilder.registerValue(BigDecimal.class, (a,b) -> a.compareTo(b) == 0);
```

### 3.2.1
released on 2017-06-12 <br/>

### <font color="red">3.2.0</font>
released on 2017-05-26 <br/>

* [133](https://github.com/javers/javers/issues/133) New JQL queries &mdash; **Shadows**. 
  See [Shadow query examples](/documentation/jql-examples#query-for-shadows). 

* [455](https://github.com/javers/javers/issues/455)
 Fixed error in schema creation on MySQL database with non UTF-8 encoding &mdash;
 MySQL error: Specified key was too long; max key length is 767 bytes 

### 3.1.1
released on 2017-05-07 <br/>

* [532](https://github.com/javers/javers/issues/532)

 Now, Javers' annotations have priority over JPA annotations. 

### 3.1.0
released on 2017-03-27 <br/>

* [403](https://github.com/javers/javers/issues/403)
 Added `@PropertyName` annotation.
 Now, property names can be customized which means easier domain classes refactoring.

* [27](https://github.com/polyjdbc/polyjdbc/issues/27)
 Fixed resource leak in PolyJDBC.

### 3.0.5

### <font color="red">3.0.0 &mdash; Java 8 release</font>
released on 2017-02-01 <br/>

**We rewrote whole JaVers' code base from Java 7 to 8.**<br/>
  Now, JaVers is lighter, faster, and more friendly for Java 8 users.  
  
**Breaking changes**
  
* All javers-core classes like:
 `Change`, `Commit`, or `CdoSnapshot` now use 
 standard Java 8 types `java.util.Optional` and `java.time.LocalDateTime`.
 
* The old good Joda Time is no longer used in javers-core but still supported in users’ objects.

* JaVers’ `Optional` is removed.
  
* All `@Deprecated` methods in public API are removed.  
  
* **Since 3.0, JaVers is not runnable on Java 7 Runtime.**
  If you still use Java 7, stay with {{site.javers_java7_version}} version,
  which will be maintained for a while, but only for bug fixing.  

Misc 

* All JaVers’ dependencies are bumped to the latest versions:
  
```
gson :                   2.8.0
mongo-java-driver :      3.4.2
picocontainer :          2.15
fast-classpath-scanner : 2.0.13

joda :                   2.9.7 (optional)
guava :                  21.0  (optional)

```  

* SQL Repository schema migration scripts for JaVers 1.x are removed.
  Upgrade from JaVers 1.x to 3.0 is still possible,
  but first run 2.9.x to perform overdue SQL Repository schema migration.

  Since now, `transactionManager` bean should be explicitly provided 
  when configuring `javers` bean:
  
```java
    @Bean
    public Javers javers(PlatformTransactionManager txManager) {
        JaversSqlRepository sqlRepository = SqlRepositoryBuilder
                .sqlRepository()
                .withConnectionProvider(jpaConnectionProvider())
                .withDialect(DialectName.H2)
                .build();

        return TransactionalJaversBuilder
                .javers()
                .withTxManager(txManager)
                .withObjectAccessHook(new HibernateUnproxyObjectAccessHook())
                .registerJaversRepository(sqlRepository)

  Now `spring-data-commons` dependency is optional
  and should be on an application's classpath only when you are using the `@JaversSpringDataAuditable` annotation.
  <br/>
  The aspect class `JaversAuditableRepositoryAspect` was removed and split into two aspects:
  `JaversAuditableAspect` and `JaversSpringDataAuditableRepositoryAspect`.
  <br/>
  First one should be enabled when you are using `@JaversAuditable`.
  Second one should be enabled when you are using `@JaversSpringDataAuditable`.
  <br/>
  If you are using `javers-spring-boot-starter-*`,
  both aspects are enabled by default so you don’t have to change anything.
  <br/>

### <font color="red">2.0.0</font>
released on 2016-06-09 <br/>

JaVers 2.0 comes with major improvements and new features in JQL.

**Unified semantics of changes and snapshot queries** <br/>
In JaVers 2.0, change queries work in the same way as snapshot queries
and change queries accept all filters.

For example, in JaVers 1.x, this change query:

```
javers.findChanges(QueryBuilder.byInstanceId(Person.class,1).withVersion(5).build());
```

returns empty list, which is not very useful.

In JaVers 2.0 this query returns changes introduced by the selected snapshot,
so changes between versions 4 and 5 of a given object.

JaVers implements change queries on the top of snapshot queries.
Change sets are recalculated as a difference between subsequent pairs of snapshots fetched from
a JaversRepository.
In 1.x, only explicitly selected snapshots are involved in the recalculation algorithm.
In 2.0, for each snapshot selected by a user query, JaVers implicitly fetches *previous* snapshot (if needed).
Thanks to that, change queries are far more useful and they work as you could expect.

**New features**<br/>

* New query for any domain object.
See [any domain object query example](/documentation/jql-examples#any-domain-object-query).

* [#334](https://github.com/javers/javers/issues/334)
New JQL `author()` filter.
See [author filter example](/documentation/jql-examples#author-filter).

* [#305](https://github.com/javers/javers/issues/305)
New JQL `commitProperty()` filter.
See [commit property filter example](/documentation/jql-examples#commit-property-filter).

* [#375](https://github.com/javers/javers/issues/375) Added support for commit properties in auto-audit aspect.
See [CommitPropertiesProvider](/documentation/spring-integration#commit-properties-provider-bean).

**SQL Schema migration**<br/>

JaVers 2.0 comes with the new database schema for SQL repository:

* table `jv_cdo_class` is no longer used
* new column `jv_global_id.type_name`
* new column `jv_snapshot.managed_name`
* new table `jv_commit_property`

JaVers automatically launches a data migration script when old schema is detected.
Data from `jv_cdo_class` are copied to new columns (`jv_global_id.type_name` and `jv_snapshot.managed_name`).
It should take a few seconds for medium size tables but for very large tables it could be time consuming.

**Breaking changes**<br/>
The only one breaking change is new semantics of changes query which is actually an improvement.

If you are using SQL repository, and your `jv_snapshot` table is large (millions of records),
run JaVers 2.0 on your test environment for the first time and check if data migrations is done correctly.

### 1.6.7
released on 2016-05-06 <br/>
