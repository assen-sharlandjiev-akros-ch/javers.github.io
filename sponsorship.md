JaVers is an Apache licensed open source project and itâ€™s completely free to use.

However, the amount of effort needed to maintain and develop new features for
the project is not sustainable without financial backing.

You can support JaVers development via [Open Collective](https://opencollective.com/javers)
&mdash; an online funding platform for open and transparent communities. 

Open Collective platform is used for funding popular open source projects like
[Vue](https://opencollective.com/vuejs) or [curl](https://opencollective.com/curl).
