JaVers is an Apache-licensed open source project and itâ€™s completely free to use.
 
JaVers is gaining momentum, the number of downloads from The Central is growing.
In June 2019, `javers-core` was downloaded 50,000 times.

However, the amount of effort needed to maintain and develop new features in
this project is also growing. 
Maintainers burnout is a serious risk in open source projects when we work for free.

**Our work is not sustainable without financial backing.**
