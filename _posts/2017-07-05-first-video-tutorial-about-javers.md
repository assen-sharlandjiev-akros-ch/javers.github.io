So we’ve got the first video tutorial about JaVers.
The funny thing is that it wasn’t created by JaVers team.

We’ve found this video on the [Makoto TV](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCAoqQ5DnRyLisPdzUodMrww)
YouTube channel created by [Steve Perry](https://twitter.com/jstevenperry).
You can find there a lot of Java-related tutorials.

In the video, Steve asks: how to spell *JaVers*?
To be honest, I’m not so sure either.
We are spelling it pretty much like *Java* 
but with hard *vers* at the and end (like *vers-ion*).

The tutorial covers basic object diff scenario. It’s really cool, enjoy.
